# Step 1: Installing Jekyll
The website is built on Jekyll, which lets us do cool things like convert YAML
and Markdown files to HTML files, so we don't have to worry (too much) about the
underlying HTML that our website is built on. Follow the instructions
[here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

**This website uses Jekyll 3.6.2.**

# Step 2: Clone the Website
- Run `git clone https://github.com/NetSys/kappa.git`
- Run `git checkout website` to switch to the website branch.

# Step 3: Build the Website Locally
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve the website locally.
- The website will be deployed (by default) at http://127.0.0.1:4000/.
